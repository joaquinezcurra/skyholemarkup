Welcome! This is a repository of modified KML files that we use at Aerocene Foundation to visualize the trajectories of tethered and free-flight aerosolar balloons.

In order to visulize the files, just download each KML and open with Google Earth! You can edit the files with Sublime text code editor.

You can read more about our experiments in this area on our community forum thread: https://forum.aerocene.org/t/signatures-in-the-air/70/10
